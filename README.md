## ðŸ”§ Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
ðŸ§  ML_trained_models
This directory contains machine learning models trained using the o3_instruction dataset as input features.
You can load and use these models for prediction through the load_evaluate.py script in the codes/ directory.

ðŸ“Š browse_trained_results
This folder includes the prediction results generated by the models on the test set.
These results can be directly loaded and evaluated using load_evaluate.py.

ðŸ§ª codes
This directory contains partial training and evaluation scripts for reproducing experimental results in the dissertation.

tools.py
Provides utility functions used by both train.py and load_evaluate.py.

train.py
Trains machine learning models using either single_attribute or merged_attribute depending on the value of the single_or_merge variable.
Includes hyperparameter search with RandomizedSearchCV for three ML models, and uses random seed = 42 to ensure reproducibility.
Saves trained models and prediction results.

load_evaluate.py
Loads trained models or prediction results and performs evaluation.
You can either directly evaluate pre-trained models or train new ones and then evaluate.
Both approaches will reproduce the results reported in the dissertation.

ðŸ“‚ data
new_processed_time-sorted_data.csv: The original dataset used in the dissertation.

o3_instruction.csv: Instruction dataset generated using the o3-mini model.
